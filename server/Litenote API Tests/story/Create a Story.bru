  title: The Lighthouse Keeper’s Wonderful Daughter
  caption: A tale of longing and lighthouses on the misty coast.
  content: Clara spent her entire life in the lighthouse on Greystone Cliff, watching the restless waves and waiting for ships to pass. Her father, the lighthouse keeper, taught her how to read the stars and tend to the light. But one night, during a terrible storm, a shipwreck brought a stranger to their door—a man with no memory of his past, only the name 'Jonathan' tattooed on his wrist. Clara and her father took him in, and as he recovered, Clara felt drawn to him, captivated by the mystery he carried. When Jonathan began to remember fragments of a life he’d lost, Clara’s world of predictability was shattered, and she was faced with a choice between the safety of the lighthouse and the uncharted seas of love and destiny.
